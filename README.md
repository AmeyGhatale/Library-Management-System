# Library-Management-System

Welcome to our Library Management System project! This application is built using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and object-oriented programming concepts in Java. The data is stored in a MySQL database, providing a robust and efficient solution for managing library resources.

FEATURES:

• Book Management: Add, edit, and delete books from the library database, including details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.
• Borrowing and Returning: Users can borrow books from the library and return them within the specified due date.
• Fine Calculation: Automatic calculation of fines for late returns, with notifications sent to users.
